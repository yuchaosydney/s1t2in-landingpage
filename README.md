# About this project

This is a base template that has Gulp working Sass, Icon Fonts, and JS compiling.


# Developing in this project

1. Make sure you have installed Node v0.12.*

2. Install Gulp globally on your machine

    ```
    $ npm install -g gulp
    ```

3. Install project dependencies

    ```
    $ npm install 
    ```

2. Start development server

    ```
    $ gulp
    ```
    
    Leave gulp running while you code.  [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) makes the development workflow much more automated.

    Whenever you make a change to SCSS, front-end and back-end JS, SVG icons, or Jade files, the Gulpfile.js will automatically refresh the browser with new changes and automatically compile SCSS, JS scripts, and icons into output files.
